The official LORE TTRPG system for FoundryVTT. More details coming soon...

## Design Philosophy

- Fast, cinematic, and intuitive—one roll, one number, with dramatic highs and rare, flavorful lows.
- Narrative-first mechanics that reward creativity, mastery, and genre-bending play.
- Built for accessibility and depth, with modular hooks for Foundry VTT, animated assets, and community-driven content.

## Dice Mechanics

1. Roll a pool of d6s based on skill level.
2. Take the highest result from the pool.
3. Any die that rolls a 6 explodes—reroll and add, repeating as long as 6s continue.
4. Add a flat modifier (+0 to +5) from the governing attribute to the final result.

    ### The LORE Die

    - Player Characters and special NPCs roll an additional d6—the LORE die—on every check.
    - This die represents narrative weight, protagonist energy, and mechanical spotlight.
  - Only LORE die users can critically fail. Trigger: the LORE die shows 1 and more than half of the normal dice (non‑LORE) also show 1.

## Character Tiers

- Spotlight characters (Players and Legends) get the LORE die.
- Extras (lackeys) roll only their standard pool + attribute modifier—no LORE die, no crit fails.
